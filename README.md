This is my 2023 advent of code.

I usually write javascript so i am writing it as my test.

how to run these.

1. have java installed and configured.
2. have node installed and configured.

```
node js/01.js

```

This will run day one's and ensure that the javascript output is the same as the java output

if not, it fails.

it also writes the output to the console.
